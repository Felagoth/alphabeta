## About this project

This repo is an alphabeta-based chess engine that I made. It works with some pseudo UCI commands (I didn't properly implement UCI yet, the go command wtime/btime give the time to check the next move).
There are still a lot of things to do, it is not finished at all!

I took some inspirations in [the chess programming wiki](https://www.chessprogramming.org) and also for some things from [Sebastian Lague chess programing youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vqlIPDR2TU&list=PLFt_AvWsXl0cvHyu32ajwh2qU1i6hl77c).

## To do
* Transpositions!
* Move ordering (history heuritic wtf is that)
* Improve evaluation function of course......
* In the future another alphazero like MC-NN based engine
